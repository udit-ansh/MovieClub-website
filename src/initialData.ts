    content: "Yesterday's screening of Stalker left me absolutely speechless. The transition from the sepia-toned 'real world' to the lush, vibrant, septic green of the Zone is one of the most stunning cinematic devices ever conceived.\n\nWhat is the Zone? Is it a physical manifestation of our hidden subconscious, or does it represent something divine that cannot be rationalized? The way the characters (the Writer and the Scientist) represent different wings of human intellect confronting their primary desires is incredibly deep.\n\nI'd love to hear how other IISER students interpret the room at the center of the Zone. What is your 'deepest desire' that you think the Room would manifest?",

    content: "Wim Wenders has crafted a work of supreme beauty. Perfect Days (2023) is a silent protest against digital overdrive and modern hyper-productivity.\n\nHirayama teaches us the art of mindfulness. The repetition of his chores (cleaning Tokyo public toilets with absolute precision), his devotion to physical cassette music, and his analog photos of komorebi (the sunlight filtering through leaves) are magnificent.\n\nThis film is a warm blanket of comfort for those days when you feel overwhelmed by research papers and exams. Highly recommended!",
